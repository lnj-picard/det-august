        <h3>About Detective August</h3>
        <p style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
          Like Madonna, August does not have a last name. Lead Homicide
          Detective in Scotland Yard for years, he recently quit the force for
          reasons [redacted]. He then chose to open his own detective agency
          called Be Your Own Dick Agency because like everyone else, August
          enjoy bad sexual puns from time to time. He enjoys crying in front of
          The X Files, solving crimes, laughing in the face of danger and the
          last Ariana Grande album.
